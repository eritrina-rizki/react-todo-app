This project is about creating a to-do list application with React.js using browser's Local Storage, so when users refresh the page, the data will stay on the page and users don't lost their data. I also used Framer-Motion to animate components of the entire app to provide a better user experience with dynamic animations. In this app, users can add new to-do, read to-do, mark to do as completed, edit and update to-do or cancel edit to-do, and also delete to-do.

This is the preview of the app when there is no to-do in the list:

I realize that there are still many mistakes and lacks in this project. I really welcome your feedback, so that I can improve my skills and make a better performance in the next project.
<br><br>
Thank you!
